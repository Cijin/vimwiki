## Write programs where you:
  * Read/write to a file
  * Turn a structured object into JSON
  * Parse JSON into an object
  * A basic script that can be run from the CLI, parses flags/args, reads stdin
  * Send a HTTP request
  * Implement a very basic web server

### Using your time:
  Try to bias towards reading (blogs, documentation, code, books, etc.) over watching video tutorials.
  Reading is a lot faster than watching video and you can be far more efficient with your time
  
  
### Simple Learning Strategy:
  * **Pepare**: Spend 1 hour Monday through Thursday reading documentation, books, and watching content.
           This way youâ€™ll have time to sleep on the concepts
   
  * **Plan**: On Friday, spend 1 hour preparing a small project idea for the weekend that will use all
         the concepts you learned over the week
   
  * **Project**: Spend 4 - 6 hours building the project over the weekend
